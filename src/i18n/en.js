  trainingAramDescription: "Application security has become synonymous with a vulnerability management program driven primarily by tools. This view is flawed. As many teams and organizations have already found out, tools often end up creating more problems than solutions. Any decent application security program starts with people knowing their roles and responsibilities. The team is then given friction-free processes to work with. Tools are brought in to streamline those processes and provide additional guardrails.\n" +
    "This is precisely what OWASP’s Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) provides as a high-level solution. This three-part interactive training aims to provide an in-depth exploration of SAMM, showing participants how to apply it in real-world scenarios. Through expert-led sessions and hands-on exercises, you will gain insights into how to embed security into every phase of the software development lifecycle.\n" +
    "Participants will leave the training with:\n" +
    "***A comprehensive understanding of OWASP SAMM and its application in real-world organizations and teams.\n" +
    "***Practical experience performing SAMM assessments, setting improvement targets, and prioritizing those improvements.\n" +
    "***Insights into scoring and benchmarking to demonstrate progress and align efforts with organizational objectives.\n" +
    "***An engaging learning experience through hands-on exercises.\n" +
    "Whether you work in QA, write code, run a business unit, or direct the application security program, this training will give you the expertise and confidence to take on today’s most challenging application security issues.\"",

  trainingFabioDescription:
    "As LLMs become embedded in everything from chatbots to internal dev tools and customer-facing platforms, they introduce a new class of security risks—prompt injection, data leakage, unintended behavior, and more. This full-day workshop teaches engineers and AppSec professionals how to design, build, and test LLM applications with security in mind.\n" +
    "Participants will gain a practical understanding of secure coding principles tailored for LLM-driven architectures, drawing from real-world case studies, OWASP guidance, and hands-on lab scenarios.",

  trainingJoseDescription: "In a world where developers strive to create secure applications and security teams implement advanced controls, we often forget the weakest (and most important) link: the end user. This session focuses on the critical need to include end-user/customer advice, training, and awareness as an essential layer in the security strategy of any web application.\n" +
    "Through real-world examples, best practices, and participatory exercises, you will learn how to design effective strategies and messages so that end users understand how to use the application safely, reducing risks such as phishing, password misuse, incorrect profile configuration, and unnecessary data exposure.",

  trainingAngelDescription: "Who should attend?\n" +
    "This workshop is for those who have already explored the world of threat modeling and also for those who want to take their first steps and understand the basics from scratch.\n" +
    "I have no experience in Threat Modeling...\n" +
    "No previous experience is necessary here, just a desire to learn. We have prepared tools and examples designed to help you understand everything step by step.",


  conferenceAdityaDescription: "Modern security defenses increasingly rely on device fingerprinting for fraud detection and authentication. However, most existing techniques focus on easily spoofable software-based attributes. In this talk, we introduce a new approach that leverages persistent, hardware- and network-level fingerprints, making device tracking and authentication significantly more resilient to manipulation.\n" +
    "In this talk, we present a new generation of resilient fingerprinting methods that leverage hardware-level quirks and network-layer anomalies—such as RTC drift, packet timing, JA4 signatures, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi signals, and even favicon caching without JavaScript. These methods work even when users employ privacy tools like VPNs or anti-fingerprinting browsers. We’ll demonstrate how organizations can use these techniques for fraud detection and authentication, while also revealing how adversaries can exploit them for stealth tracking.",

  conferenceAramDescription: "Security teams love metrics. Beautiful dashboards, filled with vulnerability counts, alert volumes, SLA compliance for fix times, training hours logged, etc. However, do any of these metrics actually make organizations more secure? The uncomfortable truth is that most security metrics are questionable, at least from a scientific perspective.\n" +
    "In this talk, I will focus on the science behind meaningful security metrics. I will introduce a framework that helps define metrics based on organization-specific goals, as opposed to creating purpose around whatever metrics we have lying around. From there, I will break down what are the key qualities of a good metric. Finally, I will briefly present the different data analysis methods and the common validity threats when going from metric values back to supporting your goals.\n" +
    "\"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it\". However, if your security strategy is built on questionable metrics, you might not be improving the right things. This talk will challenge industry assumptions and provide scientific backing to the fact that many widely used security metrics in the industry might be vanity numbers.",

  conferenceAugustDescription: "Apps run on ads. Ad networks and analytics companies require an SDK to be installed in the app to run. These SDKs are riddled with exploits, vulnerabilities, unsolicitated tracking, and disgusting behaviours. In this talk, we'll go through some of those techniques and explain how everyone in this industry does not care about you: the actual users.",

  conferenceAxelDescription: "Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing cybersecurity like never before. In this talk, you'll discover how the PentestGPT project is redefining pentesting by automating advanced analysis and detecting vulnerabilities with astonishing accuracy. Learn how AI is transforming our defensive strategies and setting a new standard in the fight against cyber threats. Let the junior do the pentest and the senior give you more value.",

  conferenceDanishDescription: "This research explores how infostealer malware turns into an early-stage access vector for corporate breaches. The focus is on how stealer logs, which are publicly available in various Telegram channels and marketplaces, contain data that attackers can use to identify and target businesses. Logs are collected from infected personal and unmanaged devices. Once the data is extracted, it typically contains a mix of credentials, cookies, tokens, and browser-stored artifacts. + Working and defense from common infostealers like Raccoon, Redline, and LummaC2.\n" +
    "The research shows how credentials for internal portals, cloud dashboards, developer platforms, and communication tools are exposed through this process. The goal is to help security teams understand what gets leaked, how it's organized for resale or sharing, and how organizations can monitor public channels for signs of risk.",

  conferenceEvaDescription: "The role of cryptography in the tech world is undeniable, but… how is it possible that encryption methods dating back to 1900 BC are so important in the 21st century? How can a random number, defeating the Nazis, and quantum computers be related?\n" +
    "In this talk, we’ll take a trip back in time, not only to understand the value and workings of cryptography but also to discover how we can send secret love messages, encrypted, on a simple little piece of paper.",

  conferenceJoseDescription: "Are you developing or using artificial intelligence in your applications? Then you need more than just a smart model: you need a secure model.\n" +
    "In this talk, you'll discover how to apply the AI-oriented software development lifecycle (SDLC), integrating key controls from the OWASP Top 10, threat modeling, and practical tools to prevent attacks such as data poisoning, model evasion, and information leakage.\n" +
    "We will explore how to secure each phase of the SDLC—from planning to maintenance—with a realistic, agile approach aligned with current threats.\n" +
    "You will walk away with real-world examples, effective frameworks, security metrics, and a roadmap for implementing robust defenses in your AI-based solutions.\n" +
    "A must-attend session for developers, architects, security analysts, and technical leaders who want to build trust, compliance, and resilience into their AI projects.",

  conferenceMiguelDescription: "In an environment where enterprise applications drive key processes and store sensitive information, vulnerabilities are not just technical errors: they are strategic risks. This talk presents real-world cases and advanced techniques used to exploit weaknesses in enterprise applications.\n" +
    "We will explore attack vectors such as business logic and API manipulation. In addition, we will discuss how attackers combine configuration errors, poor development practices, and lack of compensating controls to compromise critical environments.\n" +
    "This talk is aimed at offensive cybersecurity professionals, developers, and software architects seeking a deeper understanding of real-world risks and how to prevent them in practice.",
